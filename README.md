This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating an uncommon yet subtle error related to pointer manipulation. The program initializes an integer variable and then modifies it indirectly using a pointer.  The core issue lies in understanding how changes made through pointers directly affect the original variable.  The solution provides a clear explanation of the error and demonstrates a correct approach.
